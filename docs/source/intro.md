MooViE is an easy-to-use tool to display multidimensional data with input-output semantics from all research domains.
It is developed at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1: Biotechnology (IBG-1) of the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich. 
MooViE supports researcher in studying the mapping of several inputs to several outputs in large multivariate data
sets. MooViE comes with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to interactively filter the 
data and configure the style. For reproducibility and pipeline integration also a command line interface and an
API are available.

MooViE accepts the data as single CSV file using **commas** as column delimiters. It expects input variables in the 
first columns and output variables after that. The first non-blank non-comment line determines the column header, in
which the input/output variables are further described. The syntax for column headers is 
- `i#<input name>[<unit>](<range begin>, <range end>)` for input headers and 
- `o#<output name>[<unit>](<range begin>, <range end>)` for outputs. 

If a column name should contain commas or square brackets, it can be masked by quotes. Units and ranges must not be
specified and can be omitted. The table cells must not be empty.
