MooViE is an easy-to-use tool to display multidimensional data with input-output semantics from all research domains.
It is developed at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1: Biotechnology (IBG-1) of the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich. 
MooViE supports researcher in studying the mapping of several inputs to several outputs in large multivariate data
sets. MooViE comes with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to interactively filter the 
data and configure the style. For reproducibility and pipeline integration also a command line interface and an
API are available.
