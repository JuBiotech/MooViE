Graphical User Interface
==========

With the graphical user interface, you can easily configure MooViE, display the results and save the current status.

In order to render a MooViE scene, an input file and an output file (1) need to be specified. The rendering process can 
then be started by clicking on "execute" (2). If want to change the visual appearance of the scene, you can edit the 
configuration (3). By using the column control section (4), you can now alter how and what data is displayed. You can
navigate in the display area using your mouse.

You can enable and disable inputs and outputs by a toggle button and enter new boundaries for the values in the selected
column. The order of columns can also be changed by drag-and-drop.

The configuration dialog simplifies editing the configuration for the MooViE scene. Configurations also be saved to a 
file for later and loaded from a file directly into the current scene.
