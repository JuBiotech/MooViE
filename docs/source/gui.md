Graphical User Interface
==========

### How to use the GUI
With the graphical user interface you can easily configure MooViE and display
the results.

For running a MooViE scene, an input file and an output (1) need to be specified.
You can now render the scene with a simple click (2). If the output does not satisfy
your wishes, you can edit the configuration for the MooViE scene (3). By using the
column control section (4), you can now alter how and what data is displayed. You can
navigate in the display area using your mouse.

You can enable and disable inputs and outputs by a toggle button and enter new boundaries
for the values in the selected column. The order of columns can also be changed by
drag-and-drop.

The configuration dialog simplifies editing the configuration for the MooViE scene.
Configurations also be saved to a file for later and loaded from a file directly
into the current Scene.
