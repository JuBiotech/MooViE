Sensitivity analysis of compartment models
---

With data from *KÃ¼hn et al., 2021* and *Koslow et al.,2022*, parameters of a state-of-the-art SECIR model were analyzed 
regarding their impact on the total number of deaths. Specifically, a result focussed on two parameters, transmission 
probability on contact (TP) and deaths per critical (DpC), was obtained. It was found that the sensitivity to changes in
DpC is high and low to changes in TP.

The above MooViE scene shows the relationship between the two parameters TP and DpC. High values of DpC lead to high 
numbers of deaths and low values of DpC lead to to low numbers of deaths. Both high and low numbers of TP can lead to 
low or high numbers of deaths.
